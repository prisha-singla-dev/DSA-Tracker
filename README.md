# DSA Practice 🚀

Welcome to my **DSA Practice** repository! This repository is dedicated to mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using C++ with a structured roadmap from **LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and CodeChef**.

## 📌 Purpose
This repository documents my journey of solving DSA problems, strengthening problem-solving skills, and preparing for **coding interviews & competitive programming**.

## 📚 Structure
The repository is organized by **topics** for a systematic approach:

```
DSA-Practice/
├── Arrays/
├── Strings/
├── LinkedLists/
├── Trees/
├── Graphs/
├── DynamicProgramming/
├── Backtracking/
├── Sorting_Searching/
└── Miscellaneous/
```

## 📝 Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Trie)
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting & Searching
- Stack & Queue
- Bit Manipulation

## 📅 Progress Tracking
I follow a structured roadmap:
- **Topic-wise practice:** Start with one topic, then mix previous ones to ensure retention.
- **Problem difficulty:** A mix of **Easy, Medium, and Hard** problems.
- **Daily Commitment:** Solve at least one problem daily & commit the solution.
